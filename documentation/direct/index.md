The direct interface is mainly used by services or applications to add specific firewall rules. It requires basic knowledge of ip(6)tables concepts (tables, chains, commands, parameters, targets).

It can also be used to add rules to the firewall, that are not supported by firewalld directly, yet. But it advised to use it carefully and only by advanced users.
