Changes to the repository can be submitted by sending patches to the firewalld-devel mailing list, attaching patches to Trac tickets. The preferred way to prepare the patch is to get fresh copy of git repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/firewalld/firewalld.git

Commit the change locally and use:

    $ git-format-patch -1 commit-id

To export the patch. commit-id is the commit number of the checkin you want to send (use ‘git log’ to see it).
