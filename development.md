The FirewallD project uses github for tracking issues and the overall development process. If youâ€™d like to report a bug you found in any of the components, request a feature to be implemented (or included if you already have a patch) or just to track the progress, direct your browser to:

We have been working on a complete rewrite of FirewallD from Python to the C++ language. But this has been cancelled lately. Only parts of the daemon are being rewritten so far and there is also a basic library.
