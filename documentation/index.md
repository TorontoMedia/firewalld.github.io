firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network/firewall “zones” to assign a level of trust to a network and its associated connections, interfaces or sources. It has support for IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet bridges and also for IPSet firewall settings. There is a separation of the runtime and permanent configuration options. It also provides an interface for services or applications to add iptables, ip6tables and ebtables rules directly. This interface can also be used by advanced users.
